        <h4>ACT II</h4>
        <h4>Scene I between Orgon and Mariane</h4>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6> 
                  <p>Mariane.</p>
        <h6>Mariane.</h6> 
                  <p>Yes.</p>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6> 
                   <p>Come here.  We need to speak Privately.</p><br>
        <h6>Mariane.</h6>
                   <p>Father, what is it you seek?</p><br>
        <h6>Orgon [looking in the closet].</h6> 
                     <p>I'm seeing if anyone can overhear us.
                        This is a perfect place for such a purpose.
                        There now, it's okay.  Mariane, I find
                        You endowed with a heart that's sweet and kind
                        And you have always been most dear to me.</p><br>
        <h6>Mariane.</h6>  
                      <p>A father's love brings true felicity.</p><br>
        <h6> Orgon.  </h6> 
                      <p>Well said, my child!  And to earn it fully You should devote yourself to contenting me.</p><br>
        <h6>Mariane.</h6>  
                     <p>That's how my devotion is put to the proof.</p><br>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6>  
                     <p>Good.  Now what do you think of our guest, Tartuffe?</p><br>
        <h6>Mariane.</h6>  
                     <p>Who me?</p><br>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6>   
                      <p>You.  Think well before you reply.</p><br>
        <h6>Mariane.</h6> 
                      <p>Oh my!  Tell me what to say . . . and I'll comply.</p>
             <p>[Dorine enters quietly and hides herself behind Orgon without being seen.]</p><br>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6>  
                    <p>That's sensibly spoken.  Now tell me, girl,
                    That his merit shines like a gleaming pearl,
                   That he warms your heart, and that you would rejoice
                   To have him be your husband by my choice.
                   Eh?</p>
                   <p>[Mariane recoils in dismay.]</p><br>
        <h6>Mariane.</h6>    
                    <p>Eh?</p><br>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6>  
                     <p>What's that?</p><br>
        <h6>Mariane.</h6>  
                    <p>Please?</p><br>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6>  
                     <p>What?</p><br>
        <h6>Mariane.</h6>   
                    <p>Am I in error?</p><br>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6>  
                    <p>Why?</p><br>
        <h6>Mariane.</h6>      
                     <p>Whom do you wish that I should now swear
                      Touches my heart--and who would rejoice me
                       If we joined, by your choice, in matrimony?<br>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6>  
                    <p>Tartuffe.</p><br>
        <h6>Mariane.</h6>         
                    <p>Out of the question, father, I assure
                     You!  Why urge on me such an imposture?</p><br>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6>  
                  <p>But, my dear, I wish it to be true,
                    And it should be enough that I've chosen for you.</p><br>
        <h6>Mariane.</h6>  
                     <p>What?  Father, would you . . .?</p><br>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6>   
                   <p>Yes, I intend, you see
                 To unite in marriage Tartuffe and my family.
                 He will be your husband.  I do declare it!
                 Since you have promised . . .</p><br>
