        <h4>ACT II</h4>
        <h4>Scene I between Orgon and Mariane</h4>
        <p>
            Orgon. Mariane.<br>
            Mariane. Yes.<br>
            Orgon. Come here.  We need to speak Privately.<br>
            Mariane. Father, what is it you seek?<br>
            Orgon [looking in the closet]. I'm seeing if anyone can overhear us.
                        This is a perfect place for such a purpose.
                        There now, it's okay.  Mariane, I find
                        You endowed with a heart that's sweet and kind
                        And you have always been most dear to me.<br>
            Mariane.  A father's love brings true felicity.<br>
            Orgon.  Well said, my child!  And to earn it fully You should devote yourself to contenting me.<br>
            Mariane.  That's how my devotion is put to the proof.<br>
            Orgon.  Good.  Now what do you think of our guest, Tartuffe?<br>
            Mariane.  Who me?<br>
            Orgon.   You.  Think well before you reply.<br>
            Mariane.  Oh my!  Tell me what to say . . . and I'll comply.
             [Dorine enters quietly and hides herself behind Orgon without being seen.]<br>
           Orgon.  That's sensibly spoken.  Now tell me, girl,
                    That his merit shines like a gleaming pearl,
                   That he warms your heart, and that you would rejoice
                   To have him be your husband by my choice.
                   Eh?
                   [Mariane recoils in dismay.]<br>
            Mariane.    Eh?<br>
            Orgon.  What's that?<br>
            Mariane.  Please?<br>
            Orgon.  What?<br>
           Mariane.   Am I in error?<br>
           Orgon.  Why?<br>
           Mariane.      Whom do you wish that I should now swear
        Touches my heart--and who would rejoice me
        If we joined, by your choice, in matrimony?<br>
Orgon.  Tartuffe.<br>
Mariane.          Out of the question, father, I assure
        You!  Why urge on me such an imposture?<br>
Orgon.  But, my dear, I wish it to be true,
        And it should be enough that I've chosen for you.<br>
Mariane.  What?  Father, would you . . .?<br>
Orgon.   Yes, I intend, you see
        To unite in marriage Tartuffe and my family.
        He will be your husband.  I do declare it!
        Since you have promised . . .<br>
